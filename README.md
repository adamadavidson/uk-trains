# uk-trains
A tiny NodeJS wrapper for the National Rail SOAP api, requiring only node-soap.

The National Rail SOAP api is pretty nasty to get your head around for someone used to a RESTful architecture.  This wrapper aims to simplify the experience using callbacks and json.

**This fork** makes the following changes to the orginal:
1. Updates the Darwin version to the most recent; and
2. Returns all results from Darwin, and not just the `trainServices` object.

## Usage

Go to `http://realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/OpenLDBWSRegistration/` and register for an api key.

After that, install this package.
```npm i uk-trains```
 
Within your NodeJS app, load the package, supply your api key, and then use the returned service. 

``` js
var ukTrains = require('uk-trains');
var rail = ukTrains('xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx')

rail.getDepartures('MYB', undefined, console.log);
```
